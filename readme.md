# TinyMCE

## Using External fonts

Here is a simple example showing how to use an external font in TinyMCE.

Note, to run this example, make sure to add your API key in `index.html` where you see `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` appears in the script call to load TinyMCE.

Please note, that configuring the list of fonts available in the `fontselect` dropdown is a separate task. For information on that, visit: https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/configure/editor-appearance/#font_formats
